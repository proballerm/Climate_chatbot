# Climate Chatbot 🌍💬

The Climate Chatbot is a prototype conversational AI designed to **educate users about climate change, sustainability, and environmental awareness**. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide responses that are factual, concise, and age-appropriate.

---

## ✨ Features
- Provides **climate-related facts and explanations**  
- Generates **sustainability tips tailored to different audiences**  
- Uses **prompt engineering** to improve clarity and trustworthiness  
- Easily extendable for research, education, or personal projects

## 🛠️ Running the Chatbot Locally

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/climate-chatbot.git
cd climate-chatbot
2. Create and activate a virtual environment
bash
Copy code
# Windows
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
3. Install dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Typical dependencies include:

nginx
Copy code
openai
streamlit
python-dotenv
4. Add your API key
Create a .env file in the project root:

ini
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
5. Run the app
If using Streamlit:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Then open the link in your browser (usually http://localhost:8501).

🚀 How to Improve It
This project is meant to be a starting point. Here are suggested areas for improvement:

Knowledge Base

Integrate trusted climate datasets (NASA, IPCC, NOAA).

Add fact-checking layers to reduce hallucinations.

User Experience

Create a polished frontend (Streamlit/React).

Add multilingual support for global reach.

Conversation Flow

Add memory for multi-turn conversations.

Improve handling of follow-up and clarifying questions.

Evaluation & Safety

Compare outputs from multiple LLMs.

Add guardrails to prevent misinformation or unsafe answers.

Optional Deployment

Deploy on Streamlit Cloud, Render, or Hugging Face Spaces.

Share with educators, classrooms, or advocacy groups.

📚 Future Vision
The long-term goal is to turn this chatbot into a reliable educational companion that makes climate science more accessible for students, teachers, and the public.
